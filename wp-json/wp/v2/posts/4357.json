I try Alex\u2019s phone and sure enough get warmly greeted by an automated answer machine. A quick call back home to the H+I office and soon I&#8217;m on the right track as Alex emerges from the depths of his shed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A quick tour of \u201cthe croft\u201d included Alex gloating at his wall of bikes and the XC race bike he\u2019d be ripping my legs off with, before scaring off a flock of geese from his field by simply shouting the word \u2018geese\u2019 over and over. Apparently a morning routine. Alex spent three years of his life designing and building his fully eco and off-the-grid house, complete with recycled milk bottle under-floor heating! The tall glass windows towering above the roaring stove frame the Cuillin mountain range of Skye on the horizon as we stand with coffee in hand.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Alex is a racer at heart and more recently returned from being an integral part of Mark Beaumont\u2019s around the world in 80 days support crew. I was prepared for a beasting on the steep and snappy hills above Plockton. With the temperature still reading minus despite the golden winter sun I was soon being dragged above the intricate coast line and looking across to the white walled cottages hugging the water\u2019s edge as a ketch moors up in the cove. Alex points to a mast atop a ridge line high above us: \u201cThat\u2019s my training ride, record to beat is 25 minutes to the top from my house\u2026\u201d I needn\u2019t respond as my face drops in disbelief and somewhat disgust as I mull over the potential pain.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space][vc_media_grid element_width=&#8221;3&#8243; initial_loading_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; grid_id=&#8221;vc_gid:1700663608087-c326b6c7-8c6f-5&#8243; include=&#8221;303228,303230,303227,303226&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4359&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4360&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4361&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space][vc_separator color=&#8221;black&#8221; align=&#8221;align_left&#8221; border_width=&#8221;8&#8243; el_width=&#8221;10&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1493823688550{padding-right: 40px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1508831010155{margin-top: 15px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The trails below our tread are frozen solid and offering up grin inducing rolling speeds and grip levels. I\u2019m working hard to keep on the coat tails of Alex both up and down, admittedly failing at the ups but that was a given\u2026 More petrifying was the pace he was holding on the downs despite the XC race hardtail complete with what looked to be the tallest seat post known to man. The Plockton trails were a pleasant and surprising contrast to their other west coast siblings, lacking in rocks and technical features but no less fun with their fast and flowing nature. Any local walker is in for a sight-and-a-half if they have the pleasure of coming across Alex whilst on a training loop, there\u2019s no let up and he knows every contour of trail\u2026 He even pointed out to me a camber on the inside of a turn that been worn in from solely the passing of his wheels! We drop the rest of the altitude quickly as the sun is beginning to drop over the islands ahead of us and end up on a white beach of maerl (similar to coral). As short as the winter days are, that was good value for money\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1508831010155{margin-top: 15px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<em><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI live on a croft in Plockton, it\u2019s around 8 acres and it came down through my family. I\u2019m very lucky to have it! When I got the croft it meant I could build a house and so it took three years to build the zero energy, autonomous house. We have a view over the Cuillins on Skye and now we live a nice quiet life on the croft growing our own veggies and being hippies! <\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAfter I finished building the house I got into racing seriously for three or four years as I turned 40, which is a stupid age to start racing! I did it anyway and spent a winter in the Andes where I towed my son in a trailer up and down the Andes up to 4000m on a bike that weighed 85 kilos\u2026 so I got pretty fit! I came back and surprisingly won the British Champs and ended up winning three British titles in 09, 10 and 12.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> \u201cThis last summer I spent five weeks driving in a camper van basically from Paris to Beijing across Europe in six days, then Russia, Mongolia, and China supporting as a mechanic for Mark Beaumont on his complete mad and epic around the world in 78.5 days world record. 240 miles a day, 16 hours riding a day, 1200 hours over the course of 80 days\u2026 It was completely mad! Being there and watching him right out in the van in front of me did in no way make it easier to work out the difficulty\u2026 \u201d<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4362&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4363&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4364&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4365&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][vc_empty_space][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1508830999287{margin-top: 15px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">\u201cOne of the things that is also cool about living in Plockton is that if you look at a map basically the Cuillins, Torridon, Kintail, Affric\u2026 the madness of the west coast and Plockton is bang in the middle of it. I\u2019m 45 minutes from the Cuillins and Torridon, half an hour from Affric\u2026 So there is amazing riding all around. Compared to other peninsulas there is also a lot of trails and forest so it\u2019s an ace place to live.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t intend on being anywhere else, which is odd as when I was young I was a pretty footloose traveller and spent a lot of time on the road cycling my bike around. It\u2019s funny to get a bit older and go from that to being completely settled here, my roots are definitely out now!<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> \u201cThe trails here are a little more cross country style in comparison to the other big mountain stuff we do at H+I. From my personal perspective they\u2019re good for race training as there are a lot of ups and downs and there is a lot of aerobic fitness needed. But it\u2019s not far to the likes of Torridon so I can still get out and ride bigger and gnarlier stuff, but to be honest I rarely put the bike in the car as I just ride out from here as it\u2019s so good and I\u2019m really lucky to have it on the doorstep. When it comes to the summer and doing the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mountainbikeworldwide.com\/mtb-tours\/coast-to-coast-scotland\">coast-to-coast<\/a> it is like going back and visiting an old friend\u2026 Seeing what\u2019s changed, if a rock has moved.
