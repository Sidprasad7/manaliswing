Alternatively, you can scrub some speed by feathering the back brake, which in turn will lower the front wheel.<\/li>\n<li>Your front wheel will continue to drop further.\u00a0<strong>You will see Jono&#8217;s\u00a0arms are still bending further and his body is moving further forward,<\/strong>\u00a0in turn putting more weight over the front of the bike bringing the front wheel down.<\/li>\n<li>Your front wheel will land and you will be in the perfect, balanced riding position to tackle the next trail feature or pedal out!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>And that&#8217;s it &#8211; simple!
