From the walled vantage point over the valley floor below I momentarily step back into the medieval ages, but quickly snap to as I glance down at the blue fluorescent bike lent up against the stone wall. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rumbling over cobble stones once used by hooves and carts we pass through the old guarded archway of the walled hilltop village and begin to sniff out the other Istrian delicacy that isn\u2019t truffles but trails; far away from the hordes of crowds attracted to the south after it shot to fame in the TV series \u2018 Game of Thrones\u2019. We had our own fable to conquer, minus the dragons and bloodshed, mind you\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Having left home in the snow and seemingly jumping ahead a full season, spring is in full swing with the colour and saturation cranked up; an old farmer complete with flat cap and chequered shirt potters slowly up and down his field, turning the soil. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Briefly joining the disused Parenzana railway line before diving into the damp darkness we cut through the hillside, rejoining the daytime in Gro\u017enjan. Stopping to catch our breath beside a well filled with meandering gold fish, a local appears from his garden with a box of ruby red strawberries straight from the vine. He stops briefly to hand us a portion before continuing on with his day. A hospitable generosity that seems to run through the breadth of Istria. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">From the crest of the hill you can make out the coastline on the horizon which would be our marker for the next few days as we travelled from the green of the countryside to the blue of the coastline. Leaving the open we penetrate the dense vegetation with a lace of dusty singletrack leading us into a rollercoaster of fast, flowing turns &#8211; a trail that left all abilities in the group grinning ear-to-ear. For a relatively small hillside Gro\u017enjan has a substantial trail network which was used for a recent Enduro race, meaning we were more than happy to spend the afternoon lapping it up until the lure of food pulled us back to the hotel, although not before scaling the climb back to the hilltop village of Motovun. You soon realise why it was once such an advantageous position to have!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p class=\"bigquote\">&#8220;Rumbling over cobble stones once used by hooves and carts we pass through the old guarded archway of the walled hilltop village&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space][vc_media_grid element_width=&#8221;3&#8243; initial_loading_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; grid_id=&#8221;vc_gid:1700646428136-2b5c22e1-a218-6&#8243; include=&#8221;26245,26244,25975,25968&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4074&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4075&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;32&#8243;][vc_separator color=&#8221;black&#8221; align=&#8221;align_left&#8221; border_width=&#8221;8&#8243; el_width=&#8221;10&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1493823688550{padding-right: 40px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We didn\u2019t take much persuasion when it came to dinner time. Sitting in the courtyard beneath a towering chestnut tree we had a feast fit for a king with the menu alarmingly difficult to pick from. Gnocchi, patties, fish, pancakes, pears, all swiftly devoured and helped down by local beer and wine of which our bodies felt the full effect, so with the conversation tailing off, waistlines expanding, and eyes beginning to shut we headed for bed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Clawing at my alarm I grab my riding kit in haste as I rush, worried the others would be waiting for me at breakfast\u2026 I needn\u2019t have stressed! I polish off my coffee as Cat and Euan rock up, hot on the unmistakable scent (whether they wanted to be or not!) of the local truffles which surprisingly seemed to feature quite heavily at breakfast too. We mull over the plan for the day which was to head south and to the coastline; a lap of the Kamenjak peninsula before checking out the picturesque fishing port of Rovinj and moving onto our base for the final few days on the island of Krk. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It doesn\u2019t take long before we\u2019re skirting the coastline with the shimmering Adriatic in full view. We ditch the van in Premantura, grab the bikes and after only a few minutes of pedalling are snaking through the pine with the lure of the sea constantly flirting with us. Soon enough we burst out of the trees and land on the rocky coastline, slapped full force by the sheer beauty of the turquoise waters lapping onto the pebbles. Staring bewildered, it\u2019s Danijel who breaks the daydreaming, promising us the best is still to come as our wheels begin to point consistently uphill for the first time all day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The area is a popular holiday destination but it\u2019s not hard to find a little more tranquility thanks to pedal power, although still coming across a few families out hunting for asparagus through the undergrowth. With the sun beginning to slump further into the sky directly in front of us, we reach the top of the ridge with a narrow strip of trail seemingly tailing off into the water below. We don\u2019t hang around long before launching into it, starting fast and straight in the open before the vegetation shoots up around us and we begin to play in the dappled light bursting through the bushes. It\u2019s always the trails that catch you unawares that are the most memorable. Hugely contrasting to this morning\u2019s loop, yet they both complemented each other perfectly. Chasing Danijel and Euan as they set the pace out-front, setting up and playing on completely different lines over the smooth rocks, because well, why not?! Popping back out at the van we didn&#8217;t need to say a word, the grins said it all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Swapping bike kit for more comfortable and slightly less sweaty clothing, we stroll alongside the colourful harbour front of Rovinj as seagulls swoop overhead searching for any scraps that the fishing boats may have discarded. It seems only right we perch ourselves on the seafront to tuck into some of today\u2019s fresh catch, with the iconic St. Euphemia Church towering over the houses clinging to the hillside in full view. It\u2019s dark by the time the wine bottle runs dry. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space][vc_media_grid element_width=&#8221;3&#8243; initial_loading_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; grid_id=&#8221;vc_gid:1700646428138-c72a7a0e-a24a-1&#8243; include=&#8221;25963,26243,26251,26247&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4076&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4077&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4078&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;32&#8243;][vc_separator color=&#8221;black&#8221; align=&#8221;align_left&#8221; border_width=&#8221;8&#8243; el_width=&#8221;10&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1493823688550{padding-right: 40px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Grinding at the pedals we make our way up an old Austro-Hungarian military track, and it quickly becomes apparent how different the landscape and terrain are to what we\u2019d experienced in the days prior. The hills more angular and rocks more abundant, a lot more abundant! We gain quite a lot of height, but the climb is far from savage as it traverses back and forward across the hillside, the trees suddenly end and reveal a landscape which can only be described as what I expect the surface of the moon to look like\u2026 In a way hard on the eye as you struggle to cope with the detail and textures of the billions of rocks on the surface. We ride atop the plateau for an hour without bumping into any aliens or other space creatures before the landscape suddenly changes once again. The trees and bushes rise up around us and the rocks disappear, for a moment it feels like we\u2019ve left the moon and travelled to the south of Spain. The gradient is quite gentle which helps prolong the descending time into the seafront lunch stop of Ba\u0161ka, perhaps the typical Croatian town with amazing beach and scenery I had always imagined. We bathed like lizards in the sun making it hard to get going again with the pizza and coffee sitting heavy in our stomachs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mountainbikeworldwide.com\/mountain-bike-tours-worldwide\/the-developing-croatian-mtb-scene\">Croatian<\/a> swan song sees us climb the hill on the opposite side of the town late in the afternoon with high hopes of descending under sunset into the town one valley across. Following our <a title=\"mountain bike guide in Croatia\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mountainbikeworldwide.com\/tour-guides\/danijel\">guide Danijel<\/a>, we press on up the mix of tarmac and double track climb, at a pace slowed by our substantial lunch. The summit is ever-present above us with two walkers silhouetted against the skyline, and we push on with the sun, for the moment, hiding behind a blanket of cloud. Once at the summit we were rewarded with a 360 degree panorama over the intricate coastline of the islands which thrust rather sharply out the Adriatic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Our destination far below us is illuminated in a burst of red evening light as the sun breaks under the lingering cloud. We take our opportunity and make a dash for it, picking our way through the carpet of rocks before being funnelled between two stone walls. We reach a split in the trail with a sign; XC left. DH right. Well it\u2019s got to be right, right? The trail is as rocky as ever but with sweeping berms and some nicely shaped doubles, which I\u2019ll admit got me a little too excited as I ding my wheel off a rock and get that deflating feeling as I listen to the air making a break for freedom. It didn\u2019t matter too much though as we were in the final few metres where we came across the a group of local lads testing one of their creations. We stopped to chat briefly, though their English level matched our Croatian, luckily Danijel was on hand to fill in the gaps. It was a refreshing finish to the riding knowing the Croatian scene is youthful but developing, it looks great for the future. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p class=\"bigquote\">&#8220;rewarded with a 360 degree panorama over the intricate coastline of the islands which thrust rather sharply out the Adriatic&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space][vc_media_grid element_width=&#8221;3&#8243; initial_loading_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; grid_id=&#8221;vc_gid:1700646428139-08d41fee-400f-4&#8243; include=&#8221;25960,25953,26252,26250&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4079&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][vc_empty_space][vc_separator color=&#8221;black&#8221; align=&#8221;align_left&#8221; border_width=&#8221;8&#8243; el_width=&#8221;10&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1493823688550{padding-right: 40px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After a long day on the bikes, and it being our final night in Croatia, Danijel insisted it was only right we tried one of the local Konoba restaurants. We left the main road and drove down a rickety farm road for twenty minutes, flanked by forest and with no signs of buildings or civilisation. Eventually there\u2019s light ahead and we pull up at an old farmstead, greeted by the chatty host who quickly ushered us inside and, before we knew it, some local schnapps were lined up in front of us. Let\u2019s just say certain members of the group enjoyed them more than others\u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After a round of ham, cheese, and olives is swiftly devoured, the owner gets the message and quickly responds with a monstrous pot of bubbling stew big enough for an army. Danijel looked happier than he had all week! We had our work cut out for us and despite the owner\u2019s finest support and encouragement we couldn\u2019t quite see it off. Istria had ticked all the boxes; the cuisine was rich and full of flavour, the locals\u2019 hospitality second to none, and the trails as diverse as they come. Forget the fantasy dragons and fighting of \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019, head north, away from the crowds and into some unspoilt corners of the country. Oh and you might want to take your bike too\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_empty_space][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4080&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_empty_space][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4081&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Read the photo diary of our new mountain bike tour in Croatia<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2481,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[41,47],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-4072","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-destinations","category-travel-inspiration"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.4 (Yoast SEO v24.2) -
