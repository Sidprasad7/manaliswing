How easily it trips off the tongue, but the reality of actually <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mountainbikeworldwide.com\/mtb-tours\/nepal\">riding your bike in Nepal<\/a> is much, much more difficult to get your senses around.<\/p>\n<p>It would be fair to say that the whole experience is overwhelming and one that you can\u2019t fully process when you\u2019re there, it\u2019s just not possible. And I\u2019m not just talking about mountain biking in Mustang, with the highest mountains in the world towering above you. From the very minute you land at Kathmandu airport your senses are assailed by myriad sounds, smells, sights and people.<\/p>\n<p>Nepal, more than anywhere else I\u2019ve travelled to, is truly a land of contrasts. As I stepped into the apparent disorganisation of Kathmandu airport, then into the chaos of the city itself, I\u2019m also struck by a sense of being quite liberated. We\u2019re so structured in the western world; we have so many rules, things you must do, things you mustn\u2019t do; lines and lights and signals you must follow on the road\u2026 it\u2019s all so restrictive! In Nepal, things are simpler. Everyone has right of way on the roads &#8211; especially the cows &#8211; and everyone takes their turn, with respect for other road users.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bigquote\">&#8220;&#8230;the whole experience is overwhelming and one that you can\u2019t fully process when you\u2019re there, it\u2019s just not possible.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4242&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;3660&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4243&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space][vc_separator color=&#8221;black&#8221; align=&#8221;align_left&#8221; border_width=&#8221;8&#8243; el_width=&#8221;10&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1493823688550{padding-right: 40px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>Much more than just mountains<\/h2>\n<p>No, it\u2019s not just the Himalayas that will blow your mind when you travel to Nepal, the feast for the senses starts long before that, perhaps with the transfer up to your first accommodation at Shivapuri Hill Cottage, when you\u2019ll find yourself hiking the last 15 minutes or so, because your vehicle can\u2019t make it up the monsoon-riven ruts in the steep incline that passes for a road. The welcome glass of home-made lemonade you\u2019ll receive from your hosts when you make it up the last few steps, gasping for air, will be even more welcome than they know! You\u2019ll then have the humbling realisation that, while you just managed to drag yourself up to the cottage, your local hosts have carried your bikes and all your luggage up that same, precipitous route\u2026 on their backs.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve caught your breath you can take in the view over the city, which is nothing short of spectacular. Even if cities aren\u2019t your thing, there\u2019s no denying that this elevated view of <a title=\"spend 24 hours in Kathmandu pre-trip\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mountainbikeworldwide.com\/mountain-bike-tours-worldwide\/24-hours-in-kathmandu\">Kathmandu<\/a> and its surrounding \u2018hills\u2019 (not mountains, if there\u2019s no snow on top, it\u2019s not a mountain) is something to behold.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst you all probably had the Himalayas in your sights when you booked the trip, the trails around the Kathmandu Valley are not to be underestimated. They\u2019re fun and flowy, diverse and technical all at once, and over the three days you\u2019ll start to feel like they are your local trails, as you ride up through forests and down past villages and along paddy fields, back to your hilltop accommodation. But, just as you get comfortable, it\u2019s time to move onwards and upwards.<\/p>\n<p>The two \u2018halves\u2019 of your Nepal adventure are punctuated with a stop in Pokhara, the party capital and gateway to the Himalayas. After saying a very early goodbye to your wonderful hosts at Shivapuri, you\u2019ll board your first internal flight from Kathmandu to Pokhara, arriving somewhat dazed at your next hotel. From three days of working hard on the bike, tackling long climbs in the humid conditions of the Kathmandu Valley, you\u2019ve now been transported to the serenity of the Temple Tree Hotel, complete with pool and spa. It would be rude not to take advantage of the facilities, and massages are booked all round, rejuvenating tired muscles, ready to take on the real mountains.<\/p>\n<p>Another early morning flight the next day, this time, directly into the heart of the Himalayas. It has to be experienced to be believed, flying through &#8211; and not over &#8211; the valleys and mountains of the roof of the world. Absolutely breath-taking.<br \/>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4244&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][vc_media_grid initial_loading_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; grid_id=&#8221;vc_gid:1700645717111-f3083aa3-4485-5&#8243; include=&#8221;28890,28891,28896&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4245&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4246&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4247&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space][vc_separator color=&#8221;black&#8221; align=&#8221;align_left&#8221; border_width=&#8221;8&#8243; el_width=&#8221;10&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1493823688550{padding-right: 40px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>The essence of mountain biking in Nepal<\/h2>\n<p>When you arrive in Jomsom, if you\u2019re not used to being at altitude, you\u2019ll feel slightly disorientated as you wait for your luggage in the tiny arrivals hall of the airport; a sense that&#8217;s amplified as you then walk along the street, with cars, cows, mopeds, carts, horses\u2026 all vying for space and attention. As you reach your destination of the \u2018Mountain Bike Base Camp\u2019 hotel\/restaurant, you\u2019ll find your bikes ready and waiting for you, having travelled over two days on Nepal\u2019s notoriously wild and dangerous roads, to get from Kathmandu to Jomsom, while you were relaxing at the pool in Pokhara! After a recuperating cup of Himalayan Java coffee, you\u2019re ready to make your first turns of the pedal on Mustang trails &#8211; and what an introduction it is.<\/p>\n<p>Riding out of the village, you\u2019re quickly assailed by the vastness of the valley around you. Dry, dusty, ravaged by sunshine and wind, you\u2019ll ride up a steep, loose road, then encounter your very first suspension bridge. This is it. You\u2019re in it. All the dreaming and imaginings are actually happening! From this point onwards, it\u2019s a roller-coaster of tough climbs &#8211; tougher than you feel they should be, but that\u2019s altitude for you &#8211; tremendous descents; jaw-dropping landscapes; suspension bridges; fabulous riding through villages with the smiling faces of locals greeting you at every turn; dodging hens, ducks and cows; and rich, sometimes unexpected, cultural experiences.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bigquote\">&#8220;Dry, dusty, ravaged by sunshine and wind, you\u2019ll ride up a steep, loose road, then encounter your very first suspension bridge.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I won\u2019t go into describing the Mustang experience in every detail, partly because it has to be lived to be believed, and partly because I don\u2019t want to spoil it for you. This really is an adventure like no other, and one that you\u2019ll enjoy reliving again and again, almost as much as the tour itself. Nepal has a way of getting under your skin, like an invisible tattoo. Your reminder of the time you spent riding your mountain bike through this exceptional, surprising, beguiling country.
