And in this blog post we aim to demonstrate this and convince you that guided is the way to go!<\/p>\n<h2>Preparation and planning<\/h2>\n<p>Time is precious to all of us, and planning a mountain bike adventure is no small undertaking. There are many different aspects to consider, not just the mountain biking routes. You&#8217;ll find yourself spending endless hours on the internet, researching accommodation, transport, places to eat, trails, weather, costs&#8230;you haven&#8217;t even left the house and you&#8217;ve already lost hours of your life plugged-in to some technology or other to figure out how you&#8217;re going to spend your spare time.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve done all this research, and tried and tested the whole package for you, so why not take advantage of our expertise and local knowledge and leave the hard work to us?<\/p>\n<p><em>But I like researching and planning myself&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Okay, so you like to take control of the planning process yourself, and take pleasure in creating your own mountain bike holidays for you and your friends\/family.

Tension builds and patience is tried, and when you finally end up in the not-as-nice-as-we-thought accommodation, no one is speaking and the mood of the group has deteriorated considerably.<\/p>\n<h2>Added value<\/h2>\n<p>Would having your own personal skills teacher on hand, or a local person who can tell you about the geology, flora and fauna, or even accommodation and food stops planned in for just when you need them, help to turn your holiday into an <a title=\"guided mountain bike tours around the world\">amazing mountain biking experience?<\/a><\/p>\n<p>We will be on hand during each of our tours to offer just this kind of information and tuition to help you understand more about the country you are experiencing, and to improve as a mountain biker.<\/p>\n<p>TripAdvisor can go some way to helping you choose good accommodation and eating places, but you can spend a lot of time sifting through recommendations and often end up feeling more confused than when you started. You also won&#8217;t know if an establishment has changed ownership recently and suddenly gone downhill, or if the location really is what you were looking for. We have spent a lot of time building up strong relationships with local accommodation and food providers for our trips, and in some cases this rapport allows us to offer you special meals for your group in small restaurants that don&#8217;t otherwise open for dinner.<\/p>\n<p>With a local guide you&#8217;re more likely to have those special experiences that your average tourist misses out on&#8230; like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mountainbikeworldwide.com\/mtb-tours\/nepal\">sharing tea with local farmers in the mountains of Nepal.<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;3627&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;3628&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;3629&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space][vc_separator color=&#8221;black&#8221; align=&#8221;align_left&#8221; border_width=&#8221;8&#8243; el_width=&#8221;10&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1493823688550{padding-right: 40px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>When things don&#8217;t go according to plan<\/h2>\n<p>The real value of a guided mountain bike tour is demonstrated best when things don&#8217;t go exactly as planned. When the weather takes a turn for the worst and a ride you thought would take five hours actually takes more like nine. You don&#8217;t have enough food or energy left in the tank and you don&#8217;t know any shortcuts. An experienced mountain bike guide will be able to gauge the weather, trail conditions, group mood, and will alter the route if necessary to make sure that your day in the saddle is the best it can be.<\/p>\n<p>If you have chosen the self-supported option, do you know the risks and are you prepared for them?
