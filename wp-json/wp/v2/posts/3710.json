Scotland is where it all started for H+I Adventures, and <strong>our local guides are still passionate about seeking out new trails and creating the best adventure experiences<\/strong> on two wheels. In fact, that&#8217;s what <strong>led us to take the classic idea of a &#8216;coast-to-coast&#8217; ride across Scotland and create a whole new route<\/strong>, which would offer our riders a more challenging and rewarding experience, in some of the most remote and untouched scenery in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not about packing in the most miles from the east coast of the Highlands to the west; <strong>it&#8217;s about riding the most exciting trails, staying in the most welcoming accommodation; enjoying the best local food and drink, and challenging yourself to improve your biking skills<\/strong> with on-the-trail training from our expert local guides.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll have a couple of river crossings, a bit of hike-a-bike, tricky climbs and some technical descents, but <strong>every climb is rewarded with a breath-taking view, and the last descent of the day generally leads you into the open arms of a local pub.<\/strong> The second day of your adventure starts with a <strong>speed-boat (RIB) ride across Loch Broom<\/strong> to reach the next section of splendid singletrack on your journey westwards &#8211; far preferable to a long slog on the road!<\/p>\n<p><strong>The whole itinerary has been painstakingly crafted<\/strong> to ensure that you have the perfect balance between effort and reward, and that <strong>you really experience the best of the Highlands; its landscapes, larder, community and culture.<\/strong> As far as our past coast-to-coasters are concerned:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;This was hands down the best week of mountain biking I have ever experienced. Not only were the guides great people and knowledgeable of the trails and riding, but they knew lots about the towns and food we were experiencing as well. Made some great friends as well. The trip was perfect and I couldn&#8217;t have asked for more.&#8221; Aaron, USA.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;H+I Adventures run a seamless operation, top quality trip. I feel I have new blood in my veins; full of motivation and passion to explore the world on my bike. Probably why I booked my next trip before I had even left Scotland!&#8221; Leonie, Australia.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Scotland has something to offer everyone;<\/strong> whether you&#8217;re a seasoned mountain biker or just dipping your toes into two-wheeled travel.
