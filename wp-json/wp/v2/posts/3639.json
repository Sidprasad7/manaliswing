When the suspension starts to push you back upwards you want to prepare yourself to do the lifting part of the movement. To do this ensure that your\u00a0<strong>toes are pointing towards the ground,<\/strong>\u00a0this will enable you to gain grip from your pedals, and move your body forward to above the handlebars. In doing this you have unweighted the rear wheel, created a forwards momentum and gained further grip from you pedals that will help when lifting the rear wheel.<\/li>\n<li>Now that your weight is moving forward,\u00a0<strong>the rear wheel is becoming lighter and your feet are pointing downwards<\/strong>, you want to\u00a0<strong>scoop the rear of your bike up with your feet and pedals<\/strong>. What do we mean by scoop? If you imagine a bull scraping its hoof on the ground, it will drag its foot backwards and then at the last minute, upwards. Thus lifting the rear wheel (not the bull!).<\/li>\n<li>Once you have cleared the obstacle, you now need to\u00a0<strong>bring the rear wheel back down<\/strong>. All you have to do, is\u00a0<strong>move your weight backwards very slightly<\/strong>\u00a0and your wheel will fall right where you want it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is a worthwhile skill to practise before your tour, but fear not; if you just can\u2019t master it,\u00a0our guides will be on hand to teach you how to perform this and other skills during your\u00a0<a title=\"mountain bike tours around the world\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mountainbikeworldwide.com\/mtb-tours\">mountain bike holiday<\/a>\u00a0with us.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Part two of our mountain bike skills blog will show you <strong>how to lift your rear wheel<\/strong>, a useful skill to save puncturing your rear tyre, potentially destroying the wheel.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":2304,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[44],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-3639","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-skills-training"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.4 (Yoast SEO v24.2) -
