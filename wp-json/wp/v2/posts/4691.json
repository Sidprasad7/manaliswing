Thankfully it only hung around for a couple of days and we finally got to sink our teeth into some Swiss singletrack. As we neared the Italian border and an overnight stop in a remote mountain refuge, the sun began to sink behind the neighbouring mountain range. Running around the Swiss hillside I excitedly barked orders as Thomas sessioned this rocky ribbon until the sun departed a matter of seconds after the last shot was taken. After trudging through snow and low lying cloud earlier in the week we were finally rewarded &#8211; big time!

After a hike-a-bike across the narrow ar\u00eate (where the image was taken) we scampered down the, what would turn out to be, preposterously good descent. The weather was absolutely foul and nightfall was chasing us down every turn whilst saturated head to toe and frozen solid &#8211; definitely one of the most memorable days out on the bike I&#8217;ve ever had&#8230; I&#8217;d do it all over again in a heartbeat. <\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1508831010155{margin-top: 15px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Smiling through the rain &#8211; Nichole Baker, Crested Butte, Colorado.<\/h3>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;3627&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1508830999287{margin-top: 15px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The alpine <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mountainbikeworldwide.com\/mountain-bike-tours-worldwide\/mountain-bike-tour-colorado-photo-diary\">trails above Crested Butte<\/a> left me breathless in more ways than one. With views to a golden hour shoot high up on the classic 401 trail we left it late before starting our ride, unfortunately by the time we exited the tree line the thunder clouds were beginning to bubble up. Sure enough the heavens opened moments later, there certainly wasn&#8217;t any golden light, instead a hilarious muddy toboggan run through the flower meadows back to the van. With no one that enthusiastic about stopping I only took two shots on the whole trail, this shot of Yeti Ambassador Nichole Baker being one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1508831010155{margin-top: 15px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Watching the jungle awaken &#8211; Old Ghost Road, New Zealand.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4441&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1508831010155{margin-top: 15px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"s1\">After a day on an unrelenting climbing whilst locked in the sweaty green depths of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mountainbikeworldwide.com\/mountain-bike-tours-worldwide\/tackling-the-old-ghost-road-on-2-wheels\">New Zealand temperate rainforest<\/a>, we finally surfaced above the jungle as the night was beginning to draw in. After watching the sky light up and slowly drain of colour we spent the night in a mountain hut before watching the same process but in reverse at 6am. The jungle below was already a riotous crescendo as the horizon was set alight, moments after the sun billowed over the layers of hills in a rush of golden hues. One hell of a sight for weary eyes and the best way to start a long day in the saddle. <\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1508831010155{margin-top: 15px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Riding into the AM &#8211; Scotty Laughland, Yukon, Canada.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4694&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1508830999287{margin-top: 15px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This was one of the most surreal riding and shooting experiences I&#8217;ve ever had.

The sky lit up with a fiery pink as we began our descent true and proper at close to 11pm&#8230; What lay ahead was close to an hour of deep loam flowing through the tall pines, the kind of riding that has you shouting and hollering out of sheer satisfaction.

Aside from the great riding, my lasting impression from this trip was of the warm and hugely generous locals we met along the way, always wanting to give and help. We met this man with his mule in Imlil, he then helped us get to the top of a steep and rocky pass before returning home. I almost take more satisfaction from this style of image over an all-out action shot, the faces and people of each nation tell more of a story and offer a deeper connection than any action shot could ever muster up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1508831010155{margin-top: 15px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">After ride ice bath &#8211; Geirangerfjord, Norway.<\/h3>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4230&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1508831010155{margin-top: 15px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mountainbikeworldwide.com\/mountain-bike-tours-worldwide\/mountain-bike-tour-norway-in-photos\">Norway<\/a> had long been a country that had captured my imagination, so when I got the opportunity to tick it off the bucket list it was an opportunity I jumped at &#8211; and it was even more enchanting than I could ever have dreamt of. Monstrous fjords and towering peaks that were once ravaged by glaciers are now one of the wildest places you could ever ride your bike or point your camera at. As good as it looked in the moody weather, we were all relieved to get a few days of sun as we hit the stunning Geirangerfjord. Jumping into the icy fjords below some thundering waterfalls was the cherry on top of a big day of hike-a-biking and the subsequent grapple with gravity back to the waters edge. <\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1508831010155{margin-top: 15px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">The home straight &#8211; Euan Wilson, Fisherfield, Scotland.<\/h3>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;3508&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1508830999287{margin-top: 15px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mountainbikeworldwide.com\/mtb-tours\/coast-to-coast-scotland\">The coast-to-coast<\/a> is perhaps the most gruelling but rewarding tour H+I Adventures offer, and that sentiment can hold true for photos too. Often the most hard to reach areas offer up the most spectacular of photos. After over 6 hours of riding, hike-a-biking which included a sizeable river crossing, the views open up over a sprawling loch on a fast and rocky descent. It&#8217;s hard to take a bad photo in this environment. This view also signals the fact that you&#8217;re on the home straight towards Poolewe, by now most legs are feeling very much second hand.
