Right after I graduated, I moved to Ketchum, ID so I could live in the mountains and ride great trails every day. I did a\u00a0stint as a journalist and then got on with Scott USA, first a warranty guy and then as a product manager. Scott USA eventually bought Schwinn and I moved to Boulder, CO. It was a really dynamic time in the\u00a0bike industry, but the smaller companies were having a rough go. Schwinn bought Yeti and I became brand manager at Yeti, while still working as a product manager at Scott. Eventually, I left the company and\u00a0in 1999, a private investor bought Yeti and I became general manager. Hoog and I bought the company from them in 2001. The rest is history.<\/p>\n<p><strong><b class=\"\">Yeti has been around for over 30 years now, how has the company\u2019s approach to designing and manufacturing mountain bikes changed over the years if any?<\/b><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>CC:<\/strong> The philosophy of making the best mountain bikes has been around since the beginning. Everything else has changed. We moved our manufacturing overseas in 2003, shortly after our last US\u00a0supplier, Easton, moved their production. As far as designing, our engineering staff is much bigger than it was back in the day and the materials and processes are much different.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4897&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4898&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4899&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space][vc_separator color=&#8221;black&#8221; align=&#8221;align_left&#8221; border_width=&#8221;8&#8243; el_width=&#8221;10&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1493823688550{padding-right: 40px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<div class=\"\"><b class=\"\">Does one bike stand out from over the years as an absolute all-time favourite?\u00a0<\/b><\/div>\n<p><strong>CC:<\/strong> The 575 was one of the first trail bikes and was pretty revolutionary at the time, so it\u2019s a favorite. The 303 DH was also cool \u2014 the dual rail system became the starting point of our Switch Infinity platform.<\/p>\n<p><b class=\"\">Yeti has a rich pedigree in racing with names like Giove, Tomac, Gwin, Graves, and Rude all passing through the team at some point. How important has the racing\u00a0been from both a product development and marketing side? \u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><strong>CC:<\/strong> Racing is the cornerstone of our product development efforts. We firmly believe that racing betters the breed and is the ultimate product test. On the marketing side, there is no better way to highlight our sport\u00a0and the Yeti brand than to associate ourselves with the best racers.<\/p>\n<div class=\"\"><b class=\"\">Yeti decided to focus on EWS racing after many successful years in downhill. Was that down to a market shift killing DH bike sales or because it simply wasn\u2019t\u00a0viable to run both programs?<\/b><\/div>\n<p><strong>CC:<\/strong> It was a number of things but mostly our athletes at the time were in a good position to make the move to EWS. There was also the cost of running two World Cup teams \u2014 that wasn\u2019t sustainable. Another big\u00a0factor was the racers were using bikes that were among our best-sellers. DH racing has become Formula racing and though we\u2019re still huge fans, the DH market just isn\u2019t very big.<\/p>\n<p><b class=\"\">Is downhill something the company would ever come back to in the future?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><strong>CC:<\/strong> Yes. We love DH and the challenges of making a single purpose bike.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mountainbikeworldwide.com\/calendar\">Explore our full tour calendar<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mountainbikeworldwide.com\/\">Explore our MTB trips<\/a>.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4900&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4901&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4902&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space][vc_separator color=&#8221;black&#8221; align=&#8221;align_left&#8221; border_width=&#8221;8&#8243; el_width=&#8221;10&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1493823688550{padding-right: 40px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/6&#8243;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<div class=\"\"><b class=\"\">How hard is it to balance designing a bike that\u2019ll suit say both Richie on the rigours of an EWS race and the average rider on their local trails?<br class=\"\" \/><\/b><\/div>\n<p><strong>CC:<\/strong> We make bikes for our racers and that technology trickles down to the average athlete. While most can\u2019t push the bike like Richie or Shawn, the bike can handle it if they do. The real difference with the racers\u00a0is more tune related than geometry or kinematics. That said, if our racers ever needed something different than what we sell, we\u2019d make it for them.<\/p>\n<p><b class=\"\">What sets Yeti apart from other bike manufactures? From an outsider looking in it seems like quite a tight-knit group and perhaps maybe smaller in size to some of the brands its rubbing shoulders with\u2026 \u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><strong>CC:<\/strong> You win with talent and I believe we have some of the best people in the bike business working here. The company is also owned by mountain bikers, so we make decisions based on what will make the bike\u00a0better, without looking too hard at the financials to get there. We know if we make great bikes, everything will work out.<\/p>\n<div class=\"\"><b class=\"\">We\u2019ve experienced the \u2018Yeti Tribe\u2019 first hand and it\u2019s a pretty special and loyal relationship between the company and the customers, why do you think the company\u00a0has developed such a devoted fan base?<\/b><\/div>\n<p><strong>CC:<\/strong> The Yeti Tribe is unique in the industry and we\u2019re stoked to be a part of it. I think it\u2019s been successful because we\u2019ve committed to providing experiences for Yeti owners that are in line with what mountain\u00a0bikers want. Great bikes, amazing trails, good eats and plenty of beer are the foundation of our Tribe Gatherings and of any good ride with your mates.<\/p>\n<p><b class=\"\">What does the future hold for Yeti Cycles? Can we expect anymore exciting new bikes or projects in the coming year or so?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><strong>CC: <\/strong>Tons of new projects.
